Debris Modeling Codes written in MATLAB

Model demonstrates the motion of debris in orbit as well as a CubeSat orbit

Given any number of debris particles, the model will simulate the continous wave 
radar tracking system and predict the amount of debris particles detected by the 
sensor

GOALS:
- Explore different types of codes for model (Python, C++, ...)
- Maximize efficiency of code as it is computationally expensive
- Implement other external factors such as thermal sensitivity into model
